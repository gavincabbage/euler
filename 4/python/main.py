# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
# made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
#
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

# Notes:
#
# Product of two 3-digit numbers between 10000 (100*100) and 998001 (999*999).
#
# 988001 possibilities
#
# Six or less likely five digits long.
#
# Palindromes first and second halves match - take 3 numbers.
#
# 10**3 = 1000
#
# 1000 Possibilities!
